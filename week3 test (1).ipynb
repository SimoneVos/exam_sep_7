From `optimize` we use the function `fminbound` to find the minimum of $-profits$. We specify the function `profits`, with functions `p` and `costs` as defined above. The function call to `reaction` specifies `q2` and `c1`. The only variable left to vary is $q_1$ which we denote by $x$ in the \"lambda\"-function.
